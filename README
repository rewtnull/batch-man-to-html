DEPENDENCIES
        - Fairly recent version of Bash. Tested on v4.1 only
        - bzcat, which is a part of the bzip2 package
        - man2html

        bm2h.sh has a built in sanity check and will exit if any of these
        conditions aren't met.

HISTORY
 v0.1 (20130224) - Initial release
 v0.2 (20130225) - Fixed bug where destination path would break if ${src_root} was changed
                 - Separated ${html_type} and ${comp_type}. For now, comp_type shouldn't be
                   touched since the script relies on bzcat to explicitly unpack bz2 compressed
                   manpages
 v0.3 (20130302) - Added arguments support
                 - Code cleanup/partial rewrite
                 - Fixed bug in bzcat syntax which generated the same file multiple times
                 - Added to github

OTHER
        Change 'exec' on the final line to 'echo' to try the script without
        launching a window manager.
